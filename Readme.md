NMEA2000-Gateway with ESP32
===========================

Based on the work of 
* [Homberger](https://github.com/AK-Homberger/NMEA2000WifiGateway-with-ESP32) 
* [Timo Lappalainen](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000)
* [Arno Duvenhage](https://github.com/aduvenhage/ais-decoder)
and a couple of other open source projects.
Many thanks for all the great work.

Goal
----
Have a simple ready-to-go ESP32 binary that can be flashed onto a [M5 Atom CAN](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/atom/atom_can), potentially extended by an [Atom Tail485](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/atom-series/products/atom-tail485?variant=32169041559642) for NMEA0183 connection and power supply.

But will also run on other ESP32 boards.

What is included
----------------------------------
* a NMEA2000 to Wifi (NMEA0183) gateway
* a NMEA2000 to USB (NMEA0183) gateway
* a NMEA0183 Multiplexer 
  * Wifi to Wifi
  * Wifi to USB
  * Wifi to RS485
  * and reverse
* a NMEA0183 RS485 to NMEA2000 gateway
* a Wifi (NMEA0183) to NMEA2000 gateway
* an USB (NMEA0183) to NMEA2000 gateway
* a WEB UI to configure the gateway and to show the data that has been received
* a USB Actisense to NMEA2000 gateway
* a NMEA2000 to USB Actisense gateway

For the details of the mapped PGNs and NMEA sentences refer to [Conversions](doc/Conversions.pdf).

Hardware
--------
The software is prepared to run on different kinds of ESP32 based modules and accessoirs. For some of them prebuild binaries are available that only need to be flashed, others would require to add some definitions of the used PINs and features and to build the binary.
For the list of hardware set ups refer to [Hardware](doc/Hardware.md).


Pre Build Binaries
------------------
In the [release section](https://github.com/wellenvogel/esp32-nmea2000/releases) you can find a couple of pre-build binaries that can easily be flashed on your ESP32 board using [ESPTool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool).
The flash command must be (example for m5stack-atom):

```
esptool.py --port XXXX --chip esp32 write_flash 0x1000  m5stack-atom-all.bin
```
For the meaning of the board names have a look at [Hardware](doc/Hardware.md). For details refer to the code in [platformio.ini](platformio.ini) and look for the hardware definitions in [GwHardware.h](lib/hardware/GwHardware.h).

Starting
---------
After flushing a wifi access point is created. Connect to it (name: ESP32NMEA2K, password: esp32nmea2k).
Afterwards use a Bonjour Browser, the address ESP32NMEA2k.local or the ip address 192.168.15.1 to connect with your browser.
You will get a small UI to watch the status and make settings.
If you want to connect to another wifi network, just enter the credentials in the wifi client tab and enable the wifi client.
For all the potential inputs and outputs (NMEA2000, USB, TCP, RS485) you can set the configuration including NMEA0183 filtering.
On the data page you will have a small dashboard for the currently received data.
On the status page you can check the number of messages flowing in and out.

Conversion from and to NMEA0183 XDR
-----------------------------------
The gateway can convert a lot of NMEA 2000 PGNs that have no direct NMEA0183 equivalent to NMEA0183 XDR records. For details refer to [XdrMappings](doc/XdrMappings.md)

Development Environment
-----------------------
[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).


Extending the Software
----------------------
To give room for adding own software and still being able to keep in sync with this master part there is a concept of user tasks that will allow you to add your own hardware definitions and to add code that should be executed without the need to change parts of the existing software.
For details refer to the [example description](lib/exampletask/Readme.md).
